## SwiftUIConcurrency
An example of using async/await, defined by [Swift Concurrency](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html), on a SwiftUI app.  
This example shows a difference between the traditional approach (Completion handler) and the novel approach (async/await) to implement an asynchronous function.
